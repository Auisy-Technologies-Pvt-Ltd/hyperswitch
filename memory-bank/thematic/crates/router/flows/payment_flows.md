## Overview

Payment flows represent the core transaction processing sequences in the Hyperswitch platform. These flows define how payments are initiated, processed, and completed through various stages. This document details the critical payment flows implemented in the router crate.

## Key Payment Flows

### Payment Creation Flow

The payment creation flow establishes a payment intent in the system:

1. **API Request Reception**: 
   - Client submits a `POST /payments` request with payment details
   - Request is validated and parsed

2. **Payment Intent Creation**:
   - A payment intent record is created in the database
   - Payment parameters are validated (currency, amount, etc.)
   - A unique payment ID is generated

3. **Initial Status Assignment**:
   - Payment is assigned an initial status of `PAYMENT_INITIALIZED`
   - No actual payment processing occurs at this stage

4. **Response Formatting**:
   - Payment intent details are returned to the client
   - Client receives the payment ID for subsequent operations

This flow is implemented in the `payments` module of the core component.

### Payment Confirmation Flow

The payment confirmation flow processes the actual payment:

1. **Confirmation Request Reception**:
   - Client submits a `POST /payments/{payment_id}/confirm` request
   - Payment method details are included in the request
   - Request is validated and parsed

2. **Payment Method Processing**:
   - Payment method details are validated and processed
   - For cards: card details are validated, tokenized if needed
   - For wallets: wallet-specific parameters are processed
   - For bank transfers: bank details are validated

3. **Connector Selection**:
   - Routing logic selects the appropriate payment processor
   - Selection based on configured rules, payment method, currency, etc.
   - Fallback connectors may be identified for retry scenarios

4. **Payment Attempt Initialization**:
   - A payment attempt record is created
   - Attempt is linked to the payment intent
   - Attempt status is set to `PENDING`

5. **Connector Request Preparation**:
   - Domain models are transformed to connector-specific formats
   - Connector credentials are retrieved from secure storage
   - Request to the payment processor is constructed

6. **Connector Communication**:
   - Request is sent to the selected payment processor
   - Response is received and parsed
   - Connector-specific error handling is applied

7. **Payment Status Update**:
   - Payment status is updated based on connector response
   - Successful payments: status set to `AUTHORIZED`, `COMPLETED`, etc.
   - Failed payments: status set to `FAILED` with appropriate error codes

8. **Response Formatting**:
   - Payment result is returned to the client
   - Response includes next actions if applicable (3DS redirection, etc.)

This flow is implemented in the `payments` module of the core component.

### 3D Secure Authentication Flow

For card payments requiring 3D Secure authentication:

1. **Authentication Requirement Detection**:
   - Connector response indicates 3DS authentication requirement
   - Payment status is set to `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED`

2. **Authentication Data Preparation**:
   - 3DS authentication URL is extracted from connector response
   - Authentication parameters are prepared

3. **Client Redirection**:
   - Client is provided with redirection URL and parameters
   - Client redirects the customer to the 3DS authentication page

4. **Authentication Completion**:
   - After authentication, customer is redirected back to merchant
   - Merchant calls payment status endpoint or webhook receives update
   - Payment status is updated based on authentication result

This flow is an extension of the payment confirmation flow and handles the additional authentication step required for secure card payments.

### Payment Capture Flow

For payments that require separate capture after authorization:

1. **Capture Request Reception**:
   - Client submits a `POST /payments/{payment_id}/capture` request
   - Capture amount can be specified (defaults to full authorization amount)
   - Request is validated and parsed

2. **Authorization Verification**:
   - System verifies payment is in `AUTHORIZED` status
   - Validates capture amount doesn't exceed authorized amount
   - Checks capture is within authorization validity period

3. **Connector Selection**:
   - Uses the same connector that processed the authorization
   - Retrieves connector details and credentials

4. **Capture Request Preparation**:
   - Transforms request to connector-specific format
   - Includes original authorization reference

5. **Connector Communication**:
   - Sends capture request to payment processor
   - Receives and processes response

6. **Payment Status Update**:
   - Updates payment status to `CAPTURED` on success
   - On failure, maintains `AUTHORIZED` status with error details

7. **Response Formatting**:
   - Returns capture result to client
   - Includes transaction details and status

This flow allows merchants to capture funds at a later time after initial authorization, which is useful for businesses that authorize at checkout but only capture upon shipping.

### Payment Cancellation (Void) Flow

For cancelling authorized payments before capture:

1. **Cancellation Request Reception**:
   - Client submits a `POST /payments/{payment_id}/cancel` request
   - Request is validated and parsed

2. **Payment Status Verification**:
   - Verifies payment is in `AUTHORIZED` status
   - Ensures payment hasn't been captured already

3. **Connector Selection**:
   - Uses the same connector that processed the authorization
   - Retrieves connector details and credentials

4. **Cancellation Request Preparation**:
   - Transforms request to connector-specific format
   - Includes original authorization reference

5. **Connector Communication**:
   - Sends void/cancellation request to payment processor
   - Receives and processes response

6. **Payment Status Update**:
   - Updates payment status to `CANCELLED` on success
   - On failure, maintains current status with error details

7. **Response Formatting**:
   - Returns cancellation result to client
   - Includes transaction details and status

This flow allows merchants to release authorization holds on customer accounts when the transaction will not be completed.

### Payment Status Sync Flow

For synchronizing payment status with the payment processor:

1. **Sync Request Reception**:
   - Client submits a `POST /payments/sync` request with payment ID
   - Request is validated and parsed

2. **Connector Selection**:
   - Identifies connector used for the original payment
   - Retrieves connector details and credentials

3. **Sync Request Preparation**:
   - Transforms request to connector-specific format
   - Includes original payment reference

4. **Connector Communication**:
   - Sends status inquiry to payment processor
   - Receives and processes response

5. **Payment Status Update**:
   - Updates payment status if changed in the processor's system
   - Records latest payment details and status

6. **Response Formatting**:
   - Returns current payment status to client
   - Includes complete payment details

This flow allows merchants to explicitly check the current status of a payment with the payment processor, which is useful for resolving discrepancies or handling cases where webhook notifications might have been missed.

## Error Handling in Payment Flows

Payment flows implement comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation Errors**: Handled early in the flow, returning appropriate error responses
- **Connector Errors**: Normalized and translated to consistent error codes
- **Network Errors**: Handled with appropriate retry mechanisms
- **Timeout Handling**: Implements proper timeout handling with status reconciliation
- **Idempotency**: Ensures operations are idempotent to prevent duplicate processing

## Retry Strategies

Payment flows implement sophisticated retry strategies:

1. **Same Connector Retry**: Retries with the same connector for transient errors
2. **Fallback Connector**: Routes to fallback connectors on permanent failures
3. **Exponential Backoff**: Implements increasing delays between retry attempts
4. **Circuit Breaking**: Temporarily disables problematic connectors
5. **Retry Limits**: Enforces maximum retry attempts to prevent infinite loops

## Dependencies

Payment flows depend on several key components:

- **Core Payment Logic**: Implements the business rules for payment processing
- **Connector Implementations**: Provides communication with payment processors
- **Database Services**: Stores and retrieves payment state
- **Redis Services**: Manages distributed locks and caching
- **Domain Models**: Defines the data structures for payment operations
