# Product Context

## Problem Statement

- Developers working on Hyperswitch, especially those new to the project or specific modules like connector integration, require a consistent, reliable, and comprehensive source of information to understand the system's architecture, technical decisions, established patterns, and current state.
- Without a well-maintained Memory Bank, there's a risk of inconsistent development practices, increased ramp-up time, and potential for repeated mistakes or relearning.
- The complexity of systems like Hyperswitch necessitates robust internal documentation to ensure efficient and high-quality development.

## Proposed Solution

- The Hyperswitch Memory Bank, located in `grace/memory-bank/`, serves as the "product" that addresses these problems.
- It provides a structured set of Markdown files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) that collectively offer a comprehensive understanding of the Hyperswitch project.
- Key areas, such as the "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" guide within `techContext.md`, are detailed to provide step-by-step instructions for complex tasks.
- The Memory Bank is maintained and updated according to the principles in `.gracerules`, ensuring it remains a living and accurate resource.

## User Experience Goals

- **Clarity**: The Memory Bank should be easy to understand, with information presented in a clear and logical manner.
- **Accuracy**: All information within the Memory Bank must be up-to-date and reflect the current state of the Hyperswitch project and its established practices.
- **Completeness**: The Memory Bank should cover all essential aspects of the project relevant to a developer's day-to-day work and understanding.
- **Accessibility**: Developers should be able to quickly find the information they need.
- **Actionability**: Documentation, especially procedural guides like the connector integration assistant, should be directly usable and lead to successful outcomes.
- **Consistency**: The structure and style of the Memory Bank files should be consistent, making it easier to navigate and consume.
