# Progress

## What Works

- Spreedly connector (`crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly.rs` and `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly/transformers.rs`) now compiles successfully after resolving a series of Rust type errors, import issues, and private field access problems.
- The Authorize and Refund flows for the Spreedly connector are implemented at a basic level and are free of compilation errors.
- `cargo build --package router` completes successfully.
- A significantly enhanced and more detailed guide on integrating new payment connectors, incorporating the "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" methodology, is available in `techContext.md`.
- `systemPatterns.md` reflects this structured approach.

## What's Left to Build

- Comprehensive integration testing for the Spreedly connector (e.g., using files like `crates/router/tests/connectors/spreedly.rs`).
- Implementation of other flows for the Spreedly connector (e.g., Capture, PSync, Void, Session, MandateSetup, PaymentMethodToken).
- Addressing any runtime issues or logic errors found during testing.
- Potentially adding more detailed error mapping from Spreedly's responses to Hyperswitch's `ErrorResponse`.

## Current Status

- Spreedly connector (Authorize & Refund flows) is compilation-error-free.
- Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) updated to reflect this.
- The "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" details in `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` remain relevant.

## Known Issues

- A `dead_code` warning for `amount_converter` field in `Spreedly` struct in `spreedly.rs` exists, but does not prevent compilation. This might indicate the field is not yet used or its usage pattern needs review.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Iteratively fixed Spreedly connector compilation errors by:
    - Analyzing compiler messages.
    - Consulting `grace/guides/` (especially `errors.md`, `learnings.md`, `types.md`).
    - Reading relevant Hyperswitch source files for type definitions and trait implementations.
    - Applying targeted fixes to `spreedly.rs` and `spreedly/transformers.rs`.
- Shifted from `StringMinorUnit` to `i64` for amount handling within the Spreedly connector's internal structs for simplicity, while ensuring conversion from Hyperswitch's `StringMinorUnit` or `MinorUnit` at the boundaries.
- Ensured correct usage of `PeekInterface` for `Secret` types and proper access to `CardNumber`'s inner value via `get_card_no()`.
