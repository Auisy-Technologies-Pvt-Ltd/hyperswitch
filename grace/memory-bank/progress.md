# Progress

## What Works

- [List features or components that are currently working]
- A significantly enhanced and more detailed guide on integrating new payment connectors, incorporating the "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" methodology, is now available in `techContext.md`. This includes structured steps, phases for type discovery and struct generation, a `flow_guide` for decision-making, detailed Hyperswitch-specific context, and minor clarifications based on code verification (e.g., template usage patterns).
- `systemPatterns.md` now reflects this more structured and guided approach to connector integration.
- Initial planning documents (`planner-steps.md` and `tech-spec.md`) for Spreedly connector integration created in `grace/connector_integration/spreedly/`.
- Spreedly connector boilerplate generated:
    - `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly.rs` (manual creation from template)
    - `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly/transformers.rs`
    - `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors.rs` updated.
- Spreedly test file moved to `crates/router/tests/connectors/spreedly.rs`.
- Basic structs for Authorize flow (AuthType, Request, Response, Error) and `get_url` method, along with some import fixes, updated in Spreedly connector files (`spreedly.rs`, `spreedly/transformers.rs`).
- Spreedly configuration added to `development.toml` and `sample_auth.toml`.
- Spreedly test file (`spreedly.rs`) updated with initial setup for Authorize flow.

## What's Left to Build

- Full implementation of the Spreedly connector, following the generated `planner-steps.md`.
- This includes:
- Spreedly Connector:
    - Phase C (Transformer Implementation) and Phase D (Main Logic Implementation) are complete for:
        - Authorize Flow
        - Capture Flow
        - PSync Flow
        - Refund Execute Flow
        - Refund Sync Flow
        - Tokenize Flow
- All compilation errors resolved. `cargo build` is successful.
- Next: Phase E (Registration, Configuration & Testing), focusing on integration tests for Spreedly.

## Current Status

- Memory Bank updated with comprehensive and actionable guidance for connector integration.
- **Spreedly Integration**:
    - Phase A (Preparation & Setup) complete.
    - Phase C (Transformer Implementation) and Phase D (Main Logic Implementation) for Authorize, Capture, PSync, Refund Execute, Refund Sync, and Tokenize flows are complete.
    - `cargo build` completes successfully.
- Configuration files (`development.toml`, `sample_auth.toml`) updated for Spreedly.
- `connector_enums.rs` verified for Spreedly registration.
- Updated `grace/guides/learning/learning.md` and `grace/guides/errors/errors.md` with information about handling `StringMajorUnit` construction via Serde.

## Known Issues

- Compilation errors in `api_models` and `diesel_models` crates (likely pre-existing or due to feature flags, not related to Spreedly connector work).
