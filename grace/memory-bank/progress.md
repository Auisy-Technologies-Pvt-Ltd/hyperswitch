# Progress

## What Works

- [List features or components that are currently working]
- A significantly enhanced and more detailed guide on integrating new payment connectors, incorporating the "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" methodology, is now available in `techContext.md`. This includes structured steps, phases for type discovery and struct generation, a `flow_guide` for decision-making, detailed Hyperswitch-specific context, and minor clarifications based on code verification (e.g., template usage patterns).
- `systemPatterns.md` now reflects this more structured and guided approach to connector integration.

## What's Left to Build

- [Outline remaining work]

## Current Status

- Memory Bank updated with comprehensive and actionable guidance for connector integration. The "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" details have been integrated into `techContext.md`, and related updates made to `systemPatterns.md` and `activeContext.md`.
- Verification against the codebase (including `stripebilling` connector and `connector-template`) has confirmed high consistency between the documentation and actual implementation patterns. The documentation now provides a clearer and more structured path for developers, further refined with insights from this verification.
