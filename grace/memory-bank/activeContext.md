# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Updating Memory Banks after successfully resolving compilation errors for the Spreedly connector.

## Recent Changes

- Successfully resolved all compilation errors for the Spreedly connector in `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly.rs` and `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly/transformers.rs`.
- `cargo build --package router` now completes without errors for the Spreedly connector.
- Previous focus was on iteratively fixing these compilation errors.
- `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` were updated to define the Memory Bank itself as the core project.
- Processed `grace/guides/` directory.

## Next Steps

1.  Await further instructions or the next task.

## Key Decisions & Considerations

- The Spreedly connector (Authorize and Refund flows) is now compilation-error-free.
- Further testing (e.g., running integration tests) or feature additions for Spreedly might be next.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Adherence to the established connector structure and Hyperswitch types.
- Iterative error resolution by:
    - Analyzing compiler output.
    - Consulting relevant documentation (`grace/guides/`, source files).
    - Applying targeted fixes.

## Learnings & Insights

- Successfully navigated and resolved a series of Rust compilation errors, including type mismatches, private field access, trait bound issues, and import errors.
- The Memory Bank and `.gracerules` provide a structured approach to both documentation maintenance and development tasks.
- Explicit type annotation is crucial when `into()` can resolve to multiple types.
- Accessing inner values of structs like `CardNumber` requires using provided methods (e.g., `get_card_no()`) rather than direct field access if fields are private.
