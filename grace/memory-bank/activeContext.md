# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Integrating the Spreedly connector.

## Recent Changes

- Updated `techContext.md` with the comprehensive "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" guide, including detailed steps for payment method selection, flow selection, API documentation analysis, amount type specification, connector body creation (field compilation, body generation), type discovery rules, struct generation phases, the `flow_guide` for card payments, and Hyperswitch-specific request/response context. Minor clarifications regarding template usage and amount conversion patterns were also added based on code verification.
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the new guided integration methodology, flow selection logic, and structured implementation phases.
- Generated `planner-steps.md` and `tech-spec.md` for Spreedly connector integration in `grace/connector_integration/spreedly/`.
- Ran `sh scripts/add_connector.sh spreedly https://core.spreedly.com/v1/`.
  - Created `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly/transformers.rs`.
  - Manually created `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly.rs` using template.
  - Verified `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors.rs` was updated by the script.
- Moved `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly/test.rs` to `crates/router/tests/connectors/spreedly.rs`.
- Updated `spreedly/transformers.rs` and `spreedly.rs` for Authorize flow (AuthType, Request/Response structs, ErrorResponse, get_url, import fixes).
- Added Spreedly configuration to `crates/connector_configs/toml/development.toml` and `crates/router/tests/connectors/sample_auth.toml`.
- Updated `crates/router/tests/connectors/spreedly.rs` with initial test setup for Authorize flow.
- Attempted `cargo build` which revealed compilation errors in `hyperswitch_connectors` (related to Spreedly) and pre-existing errors in other crates.
- Resolved compilation errors in `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly/transformers.rs` and `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/spreedly.rs`.
  - Key changes in `spreedly/transformers.rs`:
    - Imported `common_utils::types::StringMajorUnit`.
    - Changed `SpreedlyAuthorizeTransactionResponse.amount` from `String` to `common_utils::types::StringMajorUnit`. This allows Serde to handle deserialization of the string amount from Spreedly's response directly into `StringMajorUnit`.
    - Updated `TryFrom` implementations for `RouterData<AuthorizeFlow, ...>`, `RouterData<PSyncFlow, ...>`, and `RouterData<CaptureFlow, ...>` to use `item.response.transaction.amount` (which is now `StringMajorUnit`) directly with `common_utils::types::StringMajorUnitForConnector.convert_back()`.
    - Removed unused import `payment_method_data::PaymentMethodData`.
  - Key changes in `spreedly.rs`:
    - Removed unused import `utils`.
    - Removed unused field `amount_converter` from the `Spreedly` struct and its initialization.
    - Removed unused imports `AmountConvertor`, `StringMinorUnit`, and `StringMinorUnitForConnector` from `common_utils::types`.
- Successfully ran `cargo build` with no errors or warnings related to the Spreedly connector.
- Updated `grace/guides/learning/learning.md` with insights on handling `common_utils::types` (like `StringMajorUnit`) with private constructors by leveraging Serde for deserialization.
- Updated `grace/guides/errors/errors.md` with a new entry detailing the error and solution for constructing `StringMajorUnit` from a `String` when constructors are private.

## Next Steps

- Completed Phase C (Transformer Implementation) and Phase D (Main Logic Implementation) for Spreedly connector:
    - Authorize Flow
    - Capture Flow (Request struct and TryFrom in transformers.rs; get_url, get_request_body in spreedly.rs)
    - PSync Flow (get_url in spreedly.rs)
    - Refund Execute Flow (get_url in spreedly.rs)
    - Refund Sync Flow (get_url in spreedly.rs, ensuring connector_refund_id is unwrapped)
    - Tokenize Flow (Request/Response structs and TryFrom in transformers.rs; full ConnectorIntegration impl in spreedly.rs)
- Resolved all compilation errors. `cargo build` is successful.
- Next step: Phase E (Registration, Configuration & Testing), focusing on integration tests.
- Update `grace/memory-bank/progress.md`.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- [Note any emerging patterns or user preferences]

## Learnings & Insights

- Gained a comprehensive understanding of the connector architecture, including the role of `hyperswitch_connectors` crate, `common_enums` for connector registration, the structure of `transformers.rs` and the main connector logic file, testing procedures, and configuration in both backend and the Control Center.
- Deepened understanding of the structured approach to connector integration through the "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" guide. This includes:
    - The importance of a phased approach: API analysis, type discovery, struct generation, and transformer implementation.
    - Specific rules for type handling in Hyperswitch (e.g., using `pii::Email`, `cards::CardNumber`, `masking::Secret`, `enums::CountryAlpha2`, `api_models::Currency`, `serde` attributes like `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"` and `rename_all`).
    - The utility of a `flow_guide` for making informed decisions about which Hyperswitch payment/authorization flow to implement based on connector capabilities.
    - The critical role of `crates/hyperswitch_domain_models/src/router_request_types.rs` and `crates/hyperswitch_domain_models/src/router_response_types.rs` as the source of truth for Hyperswitch's internal data structures.
    - Verification against actual connector code (e.g., `stripebilling`, `connector-template`) confirms high consistency between documentation and implementation, with template files providing excellent starting points including `TODO` comments for developer guidance.
- Successfully followed Step 0 of the connector integration guide (`grace/guides/connector_integration_guide.md`) to create initial planning documents (`planner-steps.md` and `tech-spec.md`) for the Spreedly connector.
- Completed Phase A (Preparation & Setup) and initial parts of Phase C/D for Spreedly connector.
- **Spreedly Specific Learnings (Current Session)**:
    - API Structure: Uses `gateway_token` in URL paths, `payment_method_token` for transactions. Tokenization is separate, requiring `environment_key`.
    - HTTP Methods: `PUT` for Authorize/Capture/Refund, `POST` for Tokenize, `GET` for Sync.
    - Authentication: Basic Auth (`environment_key:access_secret`).
    - Amounts: String major units.
    - Request/Response: Often wrapped in a `transaction` object.
    - Capture: Empty body for full capture; amount/currency for partial.
    - Error Handling: Nested errors possible.
    - Hyperswitch: `request.currency` for capture currency; careful with `connector_transaction_id` vs `connector_refund_id` for syncs. Tokenize request needs `environment_key`.
