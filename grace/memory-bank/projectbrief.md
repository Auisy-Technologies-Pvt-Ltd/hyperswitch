# Project Brief

## Core Requirements

- Maintain an accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date Memory Bank for Hyperswitch development.
- Ensure the Memory Bank, particularly `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md`, provides clear, actionable guidance for key development processes, such as connector integration.
- Adhere to the principles outlined in `.gracerules` for Memory Bank management and agent operation.

## Goals

- To provide Hyperswitch developers with a reliable single source of truth for project context, architecture, technical decisions, and procedures.
- To minimize developer ramp-up time and ensure consistency in development practices through high-quality documentation.
- To continuously improve the Memory Bank based on new learnings, changes in the Hyperswitch system, and developer feedback.
- Specifically, to ensure the "Hyperswitch Connector Integration Assistant" guide within the Memory Bank is robust and effectively supports developers.

## Scope

- The primary scope includes the management and content of all core Memory Bank files located in `grace/memory-bank/`:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
    - `progress.md`
- The scope also extends to related documentation, such as the connector integration guides in `grace/guides/`.
- Activities include reading, reviewing, updating, and creating documentation as per `.gracerules` and ongoing project developments.
